### PULSAROPENSTACK-AD - DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING OF DATA USING HADOOP AND OPENSTACK(SAHARA): AN USER'S POINT OF VIEW
## Abstract

Given the quick technological evolution, constantly new smart devices appear and consequently new source of data. Therefore an important question is the need of processing big amount of data in a simple, accessible and efficient mode. In these ways the use of the Big Data tool Hadoop is increasing  and the new project from OpenStack called Sahara is an excellent choice for both the experient user and the beginner user, offering all the power processing of the most known big data tools associated with the advantages of cloud computing, a friendly interface, easy configuration and scalability. A study was made on Hadoop, OpenStack and OpenStack Sahara targeting to introduce these technologies in a summarized and efficient way, resulting in the production of an user's introduction reference and in an application model for receiving and storage continuous amount of data for a later processing.
